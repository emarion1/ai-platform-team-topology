## Current State: Critical Issues Identified

### **Organizational Structure Problems**

**Critical Discovery:** The AI Platform Teams have a **frontend/backend separation** that creates significant Team Topologies anti-patterns:

- **Dashboard Section Teams:** Frontend/UI teams implementing user interfaces
- **Other Section Teams:** Backend/service teams providing APIs and business logic for the same capabilities

**Example of Coordination Dependencies:**
- **Model Serving/Registry Dashboard Team** (Frontend) ‚Üî **Model Serving & Metrics Team** (Backend)
- **Model Serving/Registry Dashboard Team** (Frontend) ‚Üî **Model/AI Registry/Catalog Team** (Backend)

### **Current Team Structure (18 Teams Total)**

#### **Backend Teams (13 teams):**
- **Platform Teams:** 4 teams (DevOps & InfraOps, Foundations, TestOps, Model/AI Registry/Catalog)
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 7 teams (Training platforms, pipelines, serving, etc.)
- **Enabling Teams:** 2 teams (Trusty-AI, Model Serving Runtimes)

#### **Frontend Teams (5 teams):**
- **Platform Teams:** 1 team (Dashboard Platform)
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 4 teams (Model Serving/Registry Dashboard, Pipelines Dashboard, etc.)

### **Current State Problems**

| Issue Category | Current Impact | Business Risk |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Team Size Issues** | 78% of teams exceed 8 people | Cognitive overload, burnout risk |
| **Coordination Overhead** | 5 frontend teams requiring backend collaboration | Slow feature delivery, handoff delays |
| **Team Interaction Anti-Patterns** | Excessive "Collaboration" mode | Bottlenecks, architectural coupling |
| **Service Capacity Risk** | 170-200 people across fragmented teams | Potential service degradation |

#### **Frontend/Dashboard Teams**

| Team Name | Team Topology Type | Team Purpose & Functions | Current Size | Coordination Dependencies |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Dashboard Platform** | Platform | UI components, design system, frontend infrastructure | 10-12 people | Serves 4 dashboard teams |

### **üö® Critical Issues with Current Structure**

1. **Coordination Overhead:** Each frontend team must collaborate closely with backend teams, creating dependencies and slowing feature delivery
2. **Conway's Law Problems:** Organizational separation produces architecturally separated systems that may not serve user needs optimally
3. **Cognitive Load Distribution:** Both frontend and backend teams must understand business domain, user needs, and technical implementation
4. **Team Interaction Anti-Patterns:** Multiple "Collaboration" relationships create bottlenecks and coordination complexity
5. **Duplicated Domain Knowledge:** Business logic and user experience knowledge is split across multiple teams

## Recommended Solution: Workload-Aware Team Topologies Transformation

### **Strategic Approach: Platform UI + Full-Stack Stream Teams**

**Core Principle:** Maintain current service capacity while optimizing team structure for fast flow, reduced cognitive load, and minimal coordination overhead.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Eliminate Frontend/Backend Separation** ‚Üí Combine related teams into full-stack stream-aligned teams
2. **Preserve Dashboard Platform** ‚Üí Keep as true Platform team serving UI infrastructure needs
3. **Maintain Service Levels** ‚Üí Ensure total team capacity meets current customer demand requirements
4. **Optimize Team Sizes** ‚Üí Target 4-8 people per team for optimal cognitive load
