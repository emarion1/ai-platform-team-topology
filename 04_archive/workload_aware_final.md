# Team Topology Analysis - Workload-Aware Final Recommendations

This document presents the final, comprehensive Team Topologies analysis that accounts for frontend/backend separation issues while preserving service capacity through workload-aware team design.

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Approach:** Platform UI + Full-Stack Stream Teams that maintain current service capacity while achieving optimal Team Topologies alignment.

**Key Transformation:** From 18 teams with frontend/backend coordination overhead to 24 optimized teams with full-stack ownership and zero handoffs.

**Service Level Guarantee:** Total team capacity preserved while moving from 22% to 92% of teams operating at optimal cognitive load.

## Current State Analysis

### **Organizational Structure Issues**

**Critical Discovery:** The AI Platform Teams have a frontend/backend separation that creates:
- **Coordination Dependencies:** 5 frontend teams must collaborate with backend teams
- **Conway's Law Problems:** Architectural separation that doesn't serve user needs
- **Team Interaction Anti-Patterns:** Excessive "Collaboration" mode violating Team Topologies principles

### **Current Team Structure (18 Teams Total)**

#### **Backend Teams (13 teams):**
- **Platform Teams:** 4 teams (DevOps & InfraOps, Foundations, TestOps, Model/AI Registry/Catalog)
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 7 teams (Training platforms, pipelines, serving, etc.)
- **Enabling Teams:** 2 teams (Trusty-AI, Model Serving Runtimes)

#### **Frontend Teams (5 teams):**
- **Platform Teams:** 1 team (Dashboard Platform)
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 4 teams (Model Serving/Registry Dashboard, Pipelines Dashboard, etc.)

### **Critical Issues:**
- **Total Teams:** 18 teams with coordination dependencies
- **Average Team Size:** 9-11 people (exceeds optimal 5-8 range)
- **Teams Over 8 People:** 14 out of 18 (78%)
- **Critical Risk Teams:** 3 teams (15-18 people)
- **Team Topologies Alignment:** 3/10 (poor due to coordination anti-patterns)

## Workload-Aware Recommended Structure

### **Strategic Principles:**

1. **Eliminate Frontend/Backend Separation:** Combine related teams into full-stack stream-aligned teams
2. **Preserve Dashboard Platform:** Keep as true Platform team serving UI infrastructure needs
3. **Maintain Service Levels:** Ensure total team capacity meets current customer demand requirements
4. **Optimize Team Sizes:** Target 4-8 people per team for optimal cognitive load
