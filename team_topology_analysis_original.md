### **Updated Team Distribution**
- **Platform Teams:** 4 current → **10 focused teams**
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 8 teams (unchanged)
- **Enabling Teams:** 2 teams (unchanged)
- **Total Teams:** 20 teams
- **Average Team Size:** 5-7 people per team (optimal cognitive load)

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Each team focuses on 1-2 related technical domains
2. **Faster Flow:** Smaller teams can respond more quickly to stream-aligned team needs
3. **Clear Ownership:** Distinct boundaries eliminate confusion about responsibilities
4. **Scalability:** Platform teams can scale independently based on demand
5. **Specialization:** Teams develop deeper expertise in focused domains

## Key Insights

**Strong Platform Foundation:** The organization has a solid platform layer providing infrastructure, testing, model management, and foundational services that reduce cognitive load for application teams.

**Well-Balanced Stream-Aligned Teams:** Multiple autonomous teams focused on different value streams (customer research, ML training, feature engineering, model serving, business rules) with clear ownership and minimal dependencies.

**Strategic Gaps:** Recommended additions include restructuring large platform teams into smaller, focused teams to reduce cognitive load and eliminate bottlenecks.

**Implementation Priority:** Focus on splitting the 3 critical teams (DevOps & InfraOps, Foundations, Model Serving & Metrics) that exceed cognitive load limits and pose the highest risk to organizational effectiveness.
