# Executive Summary: AI Platform Teams Transformation

## Executive Overview

The AI Platform Teams organization requires strategic restructuring to eliminate coordination bottlenecks and optimize team effectiveness while preserving critical service levels. This executive summary presents the business case for implementing a comprehensive Team Topologies transformation.

## Current State: Critical Issues Identified

### **Organizational Structure Problems**
- **18 teams** with problematic frontend/backend separation creating coordination dependencies
- **78% of teams** exceed optimal cognitive load (9-11 people vs. 5-8 optimal)
- **3 critical risk teams** (15-18 people) in severe cognitive overload
- **Multiple coordination bottlenecks** between frontend and backend teams

### **Business Impact**
- **Slow feature delivery** due to handoffs between frontend and backend teams
- **High coordination overhead** reducing productive work time
- **Risk of burnout** in oversized teams
- **Architectural coupling** between systems due to team separation
- **Customer experience gaps** from fragmented ownership

### **Service Capacity at Risk**
- **170-200 people** across high-demand domains (Model Services, Pipeline Management, Feature Store)
